Welcome to **Avalonia.Samples**. This is a collection of minimal samples, which should make it easy for everyone to get started with https://www.avaloniaui.net[Avalonia^]. Each sample is focusing on only one aspect of Avalonia.

[#_organization_of_the_samples]
== 📂 Organization of the Samples

Every sample can be found in its own sub-folder and can run without any reference to another sample. Nevertheless we have a `*.sln`-file which has all projects in one solution, if you are looking for a complete collection of samples.

You can find the list of samples <<samples,below>>. The samples are structured in different categories and difficulties. For better search results, each sample is also tagged with some **buzz-words**.

In every sample folder you will find a `README`-file, which describes the sample in detail and, if applicable, has links to further information and documentation.


[#_difficulties]
=== 🐣 Difficulties

Each sample is tagged with its difficulty. The degree of difficulty describes how much base-knowledge a user should have.


[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| 🔘 | Difficulty  | Degree of knowledge

| 🐣 | Beginner
| A Beginner must not have any knowledge of Avalonia. Nevertheless some basic knowledge of `C#`, `X(A)ML` and  your IDE is mandatory.

| 🐥 | Easy
| Some very basic knowledge of Avalonia is needed.

| 🐔 | Normal
| The user is somewhat experienced with Avalonia.

| 🐉 | Hard
| These samples are focusing on non-standard tasks, which most users will not need to know.

[#_contribution]
== 🪛 Contribution

Is anything missing? Have you found an error? Have you found an outdated sample? Or do you have a great idea?

Fantastic! Your contribution is welcome.

NOTE: Before you start, make sure you have read the Code of Conduct.

=== Code of Conduct
This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant to clarify expected behavior in our community. For more information see the https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct].

[#_issues_and_feature_requests]
=== Issues and Feature Requests
If you file a new issue or feature request, please fill in the templates available. If you found an issue in an existing sample, please link the sample and, if possible, point us to what is wrong.

[#_pull_requests]
=== Pull Requests

NOTE: Pull requests may be discussed and probably not every pull request will be merged in the end. If you are not sure, please <<get-in-touch>> first. Anyway, every contribution is welcome.

[#_fixing_an_existing_sample]
==== Fixing an existing sample

If you find that in an existing sample, that something is unclear or missing, you can update the sample and file a pull request. Spelling mistakes or wrong wording can also be changed in a pull request.

IMPORTANT: If you change the difficulty or the buzz-words, remember to also update the main page.

[#_adding_a_new_sample]
==== Adding a new sample

. Add a new Project to the Solution: `src ► Avalonia.Samples ► Avalonia.Samples.sln`
. In the root directory of the new sample add a `README`-file. We highly suggest using a template which you can find here:
.. link:/_docs/AsciiDoc-Template/[AsciiDoc-Template]: If you want to provide richer content, we suggest using the https://asciidoc.org[ascii-doc]-template.
.. link:/_docs/Markdown-Template/[Markdown-Template]: If you prefer not to use AsciiDoc, you can instead use the Markdown-template.
