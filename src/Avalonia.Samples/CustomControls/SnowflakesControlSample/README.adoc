// Write a short summary here what this example does
This example will show you how to create a custom control that overrides `OnRender` in order to have advanced render capabilities. It also shows how custom hit-testing can help to solve special tasks. We will create a simple game where the user should collect some snowflakes with their mouse pointer.

Custom Control, Render, Hit-Testing, Custom Animations


== Before we start

In this sample we assume that you are familiar with Avalonia, the `MVVM`-pattern and how to create custom `Controls`, as well as how to define `AvaloniaProperties`. If this is new to you, please start with other tutorials first:

- xref:../../../../README.adoc#_mvvm_samples[[MVVM-Basics\]]
- xref:../../CustomControls/RatingControlSample/README.adoc[[RatingControlSample\]]
- https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/guides/custom-controls/[[Avalonia-Documentation\]]

=== When to Render on your own

There may be some special cases where a `TemplatedControl`, `ContentControl` or similar base class is not well suited, for example:

* If you need to display complex geometry
* If you have many objects to render which otherwise adds a huge layout-overhead
* If you need to control each render step
* if you want to use special things otherwise not available, such as https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp?view=skiasharp-2.88[[custom SkiaSharp-drawings\]]

=== Defining the game concept

Before we finally start to implement the game, we should make some considerations how our control should look like and how it should work. To shorten it, we use a plain list of notes:

* The game will have just one level
* The game must not run infinite -> We need a way to start and stop the game
* The game must render several snowflakes (represented as circles)
    ** Each snowflake should have a random start position
    ** Each snowflake should be able to move with different speed
    ** Snowflakes should be of different sizes
* The user should be able to collect some score
    ** The user must be able to collect snowflakes with their mouse device
    ** Nice to have: The user should be able to see their current score
    ** Nice to have: Show a score indicator for each hit snowflake


== The Solution

// This is where you explain the possible solution you provide in this sample. 
// If you have more than one option to solve the issue, use Approach 1, Approach 2, ... 

We will create a custom control that will draw itself based on the data provided.

NOTE: To show you how this control can be bound to a `ViewModel` we will use the `MVVM`-pattern for demonstration here, even if it is not really needed in our case.

=== Step 1: Prepare the Snowflake-Model

In the folder `Models` we create a new file `Snowflake.cs` which will have the following properties:

.Public properties of the snowflake class
|===
|Property |Type |Description

|X          | double | Gets the horizontal position in relative unit (0 ... 1)
|Y          | double | Gets the vertical position in relative unit (0 ... 1)
|Diameter   | double | Gets the diameter in pixel
|Radius     | double | Gets the radius in pixel
|Speed      | double | Gets the peed of the snowflake in 1/second (relative unit)

|===

As we want the control to be of any size and resizable, we store the position in relative units which we need to convert into the actual viewport on request.

TIP: In Avalonia you can use `Bounds` to get the Controls bounds, which we here call "viewport"

To achieve this conversion we add method that takes a `Rect` as parameter and returns a `Point` positioned inside this rectangle.

[source,csharp]
----
public Point GetCenterForViewport(Rect viewport)
{
    return new Point(X * viewport.Width + viewport.Left,
        Y * viewport.Height + viewport.Top);
}
----

Now that would be enough to render the snowflakes, but these should also be able to move. Since speed is in `1/second` we can use the elapsed time between two frames to calculate the new position.

[source,csharp]
----
public void Move(double elapsedMilliseconds)
{
    // Speed is in 1/sec so we have to convert it into 1/ms.
    Y += elapsedMilliseconds * Speed / 1000.0;

    if (Y > 1)
    {
        Y = 0;
    }
}
----

Since we also want the snowflake to be hit-able, we need a way to test whether a certain point is inside or outside our bounds. As we represent the snowflake as circles, this is straight forward:

[source,csharp]
----
public bool IsHit(Point point, Rect viewport)
{
    // since the snowflake is represented as a circle, we just can test
    // if the distance to the center is equal of smaller than the radius.

    var distance = ((Vector)(GetCenterForViewport(viewport) - point)).Length;
    return distance <= Radius;
}
----

Last but not least the hit-score can be calculated in the following way:

[source,csharp]
----
public int GetHitScore()
{
    // The smaller and the faster the snowflake, the higher the score.
    return (int)(1/Radius * 200 + Speed / 10.0);
}
----

Here is the final class xref:Models/Snowflake.cs[]

=== Step 2: Set up the GameViewModel

The `ViewModel` will be responsible for creating and managing the snowflakes, tracking the game status and storing the users current score.

It has the following public properties:

.Public properties of the SnowflakeGameViewModel-class
|===
|Property |Type |Description

|Snowflakes
|ObservableCollection<Snowflake>
|Gets a collection of available snowflakes.

|GameDuration
|TimeSpan
|Gets or sets the duration of the game. Also updates GameDurationMilliseconds.

|GameDurationMilliseconds
|double
|Gets duration of the game in milliseconds.

|MillisecondsRemaining
|double
|Gets how many times is remaining in milliseconds.

|IsGameRunning
|bool
|Gets or sets if the game is currently running.

|Score
|double
|Gets or sets the current users score.

|===

In addition, we need these two private fields:

.Private fields of the SnowflakeGameViewModel-class
|===
|Field |Type |Description

|_gameTimer
|DispatcherTimer
|A readonly timer that ticks every 100 ms and updates the game status. Only active if the game is running.

|_stopwatch
|Stopwatch
|A readonly stopwatch to measure elapsed game time. Will be reset when the game ends.

|===

To start a new game we add a xref:../../MVVM/CommandSample/README.adoc[[Command\]] which will clear any previous snowflakes, add some new snowflakes with random parameters and start the game:

[source,csharp]
----
[RelayCommand]
private void StartGame()
{
    // Clear all snowflakes.
    Snowflakes.Clear();

    // Reset game score.
    Score = 0;

    // Add some snowflakes at random positions, having random diameters and speed.
    for (int i = 0; i < 200; i++)
    {
        Snowflakes.Add(new Snowflake(
            Random.Shared.NextDouble(),
            Random.Shared.NextDouble(),
            Random.Shared.NextDouble() * 5 + 2,
            Random.Shared.NextDouble() / 5 + 0.1));
    }

    // Set game time.
    GameDuration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);

    // Indicate that game has started.
    IsGameRunning = true;

    // Start the timer and stopwatch.
    _stopwatch.Restart();
    _gameTimer.Start();
}
----

Finally, we need to update the game status whenever the game timer ticks. This is done in this handler:

[source,csharp]
----
private void OnGameTimerTick(object? sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Update the remaining milliseconds left.
    OnPropertyChanged(nameof(MillisecondsRemaining));

    // If no more time is left, stop the timer and stopwatch and stop the game.
    if (MillisecondsRemaining <= 0)
    {
        _gameTimer.Stop();
        _stopwatch.Stop();
        IsGameRunning = false;
    }
}
----

Here is the final class: xref:ViewModels/SnowflakeGameViewModel.cs[]

=== Step 3: Add the SnowflakesControl

Now it's time to add the needed `Control` to render our game. Therefore, we add a new folder `Controls` and inside we add a new class `SnowflakesControl.cs`. This class must inherit `Control`. In addition, we want to implement the interface `ICustomHitTest` in order to control hit-testing on our own.

The control needs some https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/guides/custom-controls/how-to-create-advanced-custom-controls[[AvaloniaProperties\]] to allow us to bind to it.

.Public bindable properties of the SnowflakesControl-class

|===
|Property |Type |Description

|Snowflakes
|IList<Snowflake>
|Gets or sets a list of snowflakes to render. This is a direct property.

|IsRunning
|bool
|Gets or sets if the game is running. This is a styled property.

|Score
|double
|Gets or sets the users score. This is a direct property.

|===

All the above properties should trigger a new render pass if they change. We can du this by adding the following line into the static constructor:

[source,csharp]
----
static SnowflakesControl()
{
    // Make sure Render is updated whenever one of these properties changes
    AffectsRender<SnowflakesControl>(IsRunningProperty, SnowflakesProperty, ScoreProperty);
}
----

In addition, we have one private field as follows:

.Private fields of the SnowflakesControl-class
|===
|Field |Type |Description

|_stopwatch
|Stopwatch
|A readonly stopwatch to measure elapsed between two render frames. Will be reset after each render frame.

|===

The stopwatch will be started or stopped whenever `IsRunning` changed. We can do this by overriding `OnPropertyChanged` and filter for the property of interest accordingly:

[source,csharp]
----
protected override void OnPropertyChanged(AvaloniaPropertyChangedEventArgs change)
{
    base.OnPropertyChanged(change);

    // If IsRunning is updated, we need to start or stop the stopwatch accordingly.
    if (change.Property == IsRunningProperty)
    {
        if (change.GetNewValue<bool>())
        {
            // Resets and starts the stopwatch
            _stopwatch.Restart();
        }
        else
        {
            _stopwatch.Stop();
        }
    }
}
----

This is all we need to start rendering. If you override `OnRender`, you will get a `DrawingContext` that has several methods available to render low-level geometry. So let's do that and render our snowflakes:

[source, cs]
----
public override void Render(DrawingContext context)
{
    // Figure out how much time elapsed since last render loop
    var elapsedMilliseconds = _stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds;

    foreach (var snowFlake in Snowflakes)
    {
        // If the game is running, move each flake to it's updated position
        if (IsRunning)
        {
            snowFlake.Move(elapsedMilliseconds);
        }

        // Draw the snowflake (we use a simple circle here)
        context.DrawEllipse(
            Brushes.White,
            null,
            snowFlake.GetCenterForViewport(Bounds),
            snowFlake.Radius,
            snowFlake.Radius);
    }

    base.Render(context);

    // Request next frame as soon as possible, if the game is running. Remember to reset the stopwatch.
    if (IsRunning)
    {
        Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(InvalidateVisual, DispatcherPriority.Background);
        _stopwatch.Restart();
    }
}
----

NOTE: We use `Dispatcher.UIThread.Post` to request the next frame in order to give the UI-thread enough time to handle input etc. If we didn't use the dispatcher, the app would freeze.

This is how a single render frame would look like:

.Result of a single render loop
image:_docs/single_render_frame.png[]

As we wanted to implement `ICustomHitTest`, we will add the needed interface members, which is just the following method here:

[source,csharp]
----
public bool HitTest(Point point)
{
    if (!IsRunning) return false;

    var snowFlake = Snowflakes.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsHit(point, Bounds));
    if (snowFlake != null)
    {
        Snowflakes.Remove(snowFlake);
        Score += snowFlake.GetHitScore();
    }

    return snowFlake != null;
}
----

What this method does is:

* If the game is not running, the control shouldn't receive any hit
* If the game is running, search for any snowflake hit by the pointer
** If one is found, remove it from the collection
** If one is found, add the score to the total score

Here is the final class xref:Controls/SnowflakesControl.cs[]

=== Step 4: Add the control to the view

To use the control, just add it to any sample view.

NOTE: Remember to add the needed xml-namespaces

[source,xml]
----
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
             xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:SnowflakesControlSample.Controls"
             xmlns:viewModels="clr-namespace:SnowflakesControlSample.ViewModels"
             mc:Ignorable="d"
             d:DesignWidth="800"
             d:DesignHeight="450"
             x:Class="SnowflakesControlSample.Views.MainView"
             x:DataType="viewModels:SnowflakeGameViewModel">

    <Design.DataContext>
        <!-- This only sets the DataContext for the previewer in an IDE,
             to set the actual DataContext for runtime, set the DataContext property in code (look at App.axaml.cs) -->
        <viewModels:SnowflakeGameViewModel />
    </Design.DataContext>

    <Panel>
        <!-- Just some Background for a nicer UI -->
        <Panel.Background>
            ...
        </Panel.Background>

        <!-- This is our SnowFlakesControl. It can be used like any other Control. -->
        <controls:SnowflakesControl HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"
                                    VerticalAlignment="Stretch"
                                    IsRunning="{Binding IsGameRunning}"
                                    Snowflakes="{Binding Snowflakes}"
                                    Score="{Binding Score}" />

        <!-- Add a Progressbar to indicate the left time  here -->
        <ProgressBar ... />

        <!-- Add a Button the start command here -->
        <Button ... />
    </Panel>
</UserControl>
----

TIP: In `App.axaml` set `RequestedThemeVariant` to `"Dark"` for a better visibility of the white snowflakes.

This is how the control will look like now (notice how the snowflakes disappear):

.First run output
image:_docs/First_run.png[]


Here is the final class xref:Views/MainView.axaml[]

=== Bonus 1: Implement a custom draw operation

If the provided render operations are not enough, you can create a new class which implements `ICustomDrawOperation`. In this sample we want to display the user score with a nice glow effect using the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp?view=skiasharp-2.88[[`SkiaSharp-API`\]].

The interface requires the following members to be implemented:

.`ICustomDrawOperation`-members
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|Equals
|bool
|We can just return false here as we don't want to reuse the class. Might be a good idea for a real-world App.

|Dispose
|void
|Use this in case you need to dispose or clean up anything.

|HitTest
|bool
|Hit test the geometry in this node.

|Render
|void
|This method will provide a `ImmediateDrawingContext` which gives you many low-level options to render.

|Bounds
|Rect
|Gets the bounds of the visible content in the node in global coordinates.

|===

In addition to the interface members we will add one more property:

.Properties of ScoreRenderer
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|Text
|string
|Private readonly property which holds the text to render

|===


Let's see how the `Render`-method looks like:

[source,csharp]
----
public void Render(ImmediateDrawingContext context)
{
    // Try to get the skia-feature.
    var leaseFeature = context.TryGetFeature<ISkiaSharpApiLeaseFeature>();

    // In case we didn't find it, render the text with a fallback.
    if (leaseFeature == null)
    {
        var glyphs = Text.Select(c => Typeface.Default.GlyphTypeface.GetGlyph(c)).ToArray();

        var glyphRun = new GlyphRun(Typeface.Default.GlyphTypeface,
            20,
            Text.AsMemory(),
            glyphs,
            Bounds.TopRight - new Point(50, 50));

        context.DrawGlyphRun(Brushes.Goldenrod, glyphRun.TryCreateImmutableGlyphRunReference()!);
    }
    // Otherwise use SkiaSharp to render the text and apply some glow-effect.
    // Find the SkiaSharp-API here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp?view=skiasharp-2.88
    else
    {
        using var lease = leaseFeature.Lease();
        var canvas = lease.SkCanvas;
        canvas.Save();

        using (var paint = new SKPaint())
        {
            paint.Shader = SKShader.CreateColor(SKColors.Goldenrod);
            paint.TextSize = 30;
            paint.TextAlign = SKTextAlign.Right;

            var origin = Bounds.TopRight.ToSKPoint();
            origin.Offset(-25, +50);

            paint.ImageFilter = SKImageFilter.CreateDropShadow(0, 0, 10, 10, SKColors.White);
            canvas.DrawText(Text, origin, paint);
        }
        canvas.Restore();
    }
}
----

TIP: SkiaSharp may be not always available. In this case it is highly recommended to provide a fallback.

NOTE: You may see a warning about using an unstable API. This is okay to ignore, however you may need to adjust your code when you update to a newer Avalonia version.

To consume the custom draw operation, add the following line into `SnowflakesControl.OnRender`:

[source,csharp]
----
public override void Render(DrawingContext context)
{
    // [...]

    context.Custom(new ScoreRenderer(Bounds, $"Your score: {Score:N0}"));

    // [...]
}
----

If you now run the sample again, you can see the following outcome:

.Second run output
image::_docs/Second_run.png[]


Here is the final class xref:Controls/ScoreRenderer.cs[]

=== Bonus 2: Adding some beauty to the game

White snowflakes on a black screen may be boring for some users. In addition, the user can't really see how much score each caught snowflake has gained. Let's improve this.

In `MainView` we add a Background to the root `Panel`:

[source,xml]
----
<Panel.Background>
    <LinearGradientBrush StartPoint="0,0" EndPoint="0%,100%">
        <GradientStop Offset="0"   Color="DarkBlue" />
        <GradientStop Offset=".85" Color="LightSkyBlue" />
        <GradientStop Offset=".85" Color="LimeGreen" />
        <GradientStop Offset="1"   Color="DarkGreen" />
    </LinearGradientBrush>
</Panel.Background>
----

Moreover, we want to render some score hints for each hit snowflake. Similar to our `Snowflake`-class we will add the internal class `ScoreHint` which has the following properties:

TIP: This class can be internal as it is only meant to be consumed by the control itself.

We won't go into too much detail here as the concept is very close to the already discussed `Snowflake`-class. Only noticeable difference is that it has a reference to an `ICollection<ScoreHint>` in order to remove itself after the display time:

[source,csharp]
----
internal void Update(double elapsedMilliseconds)
{
    // Increment total elapsed time
    _elapsedMillisecondsTotal += elapsedMilliseconds;

    // remove this item from the collection if it was there for 1 second (1000 ms)
    if (_elapsedMillisecondsTotal >= 1000)
    {
        _scoreHintsCollection.Remove(this);
    }

    // after 500 ms we wipe out the opacity and move the text upwards
    if (_elapsedMillisecondsTotal > 500)
    {
        var percentage = (_elapsedMillisecondsTotal - 500) / 500;
        Opacity = Math.Max(1.0 - percentage, 0); // Negative opacity doesn't work, so make sure it is always positive.
        Y -= (0.01 * percentage); // move slightly up.
    }
}
----

Here is the final class: xref:Models/ScoreHint.cs[]

We display the score hint in the `SnowflakeControl.OnRender`-method as follows:

[source,csharp]
----
public override void Render(DrawingContext context)
{
    foreach (var scoreHint in _scoreHintsCollection.ToArray())
    {
        // If the game is running, move each flake to it's updated position
        if (IsRunning)
        {
            scoreHint.Update(elapsedMilliseconds);
        }

        // Use a formatted text to render the score hint.
        var formattedText =
            new FormattedText(
                scoreHint.ToString(),
                CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
                FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
                Typeface.Default,
                20,
                new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Yellow, scoreHint.Opacity));

        context.DrawText(formattedText, scoreHint.GetTopLeftForViewport(Bounds, new Size(formattedText.Width, formattedText.Height)));
    }
}
----
