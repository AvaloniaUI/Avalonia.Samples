This is an F# implementation of the Music Store application. It demonstrates how to build the same highly graphical desktop app using F# instead of C#, while maintaining the same functionality and architecture.

== About This Sample

This project is an F# port of the C# Music Store tutorial located at `src/Avalonia.Samples/CompleteApps/Avalonia.MusicStore/`. It provides the same functionality - a desktop music store app that searches the iTunes API and displays album covers with acrylic blur effects - but implemented using F# syntax and idioms.

=== What's the Same

* Application architecture using MVVM pattern with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
* All XAML views and layouts (MainWindow, MusicStoreWindow, AlbumView, etc.)
* iTunes API integration for album search
* Acrylic blur window styling and graphical album tiles
* Data persistence with local caching
* Messaging between view models using WeakReferenceMessenger

=== What's Different

* Implementation language: F# instead of C#
* F# syntax for view models, models, and business logic
* F# records for immutable data structures
* Functional programming patterns where applicable

== Full Tutorial

For a complete step-by-step tutorial explaining the application architecture, MVVM patterns, and implementation details, please refer to the original C# version's README:

link:../../../CompleteApps/Avalonia.MusicStore/README.adoc[Music Store App Tutorial (C#)]

The tutorial covers:

* Setting up the project with MVVM
* Window styling with acrylic blur effects
* Creating and managing dialog windows
* Implementing album search with the iTunes API
* Data binding and observable collections
* Loading and displaying images asynchronously
* Data persistence and caching

== Running This Sample

. Open the solution in your IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, or VS Code with Ionide)
. Ensure you have .NET 9.0 SDK installed
. Build and run the project
. Click the store icon to search for albums
. Type a search term and select albums to add to your collection
